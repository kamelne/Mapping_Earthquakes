# Mapping Earthquakes
## Summary
Using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON I created a dynamic map showing global earthquake data for the past week. The map has three map styles and three overlays which the use can toggle between or turn on/off. To show the significance of the earthquake the radius and color of the circle marker varies based on magnitude of the earthquake. Finally tectonic plate lines are shown to see the correlation of earthquakes to distance from a tectonic plate.
